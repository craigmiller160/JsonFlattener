# JSON Flattener

A simple NodeJS (JavaScript) script to flatten JSON. Here's how it works:

1. [Install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Verify installation by running `node -v` from your command line.
3. Download this repository by using the green "Code" dropdown on this page.
4. Unzip the downloaded archive.
5. The `demo.json` file is there for demonstration purposes. Look at it, it has spaces/newlines/etc.
6. Run the demo by using `npm run start demo.json`. You will see an output that is the flattened version of the `demo.json`.
7. Copy/paste the JSON file you want to flatten to the project directory. Then run the same command as above, but replace `demo.json` with the name of your file.
8. Copy/paste the command line output to a new file.
